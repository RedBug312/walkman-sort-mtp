# walkman-sort-mtp
A python script that transfer sorted MP3 audio files via MTP

## Intro
My Walkman MP3 player (Sony NWZ-B163F) failed reading ID3 tags, the songs inside can only be sorted as uploading order. I have to upload them one-by-one since Bash script does not work on MTP.
For this situation, this script will uploads all the MP3 audio files in your Music folder, sorting by ID3 tags in the audio files.

## Usage

```
$ pip install eyed3 tqdm
$ ./upload.py [options] <SOURCE_DIR> <DEVICE_DIR>
```

Note that `<DEVICE_DIR>` should be started with `mtp:/` as its root directory.

Options:
* `-s`, `--sort`: sorting criteria with same denotations as eyed3, default is `aAn`
* `-n`, `--no`: print the order of the files but not upload (not implemented)
* `-f`, `--force-after`: overwrite songs on device after new songs
* `-F`, `--force-all`: overwrite all songs on device
* `-d`, `--delete`: delete the folder on device first (not implemented)

You can run `$ ./upload.py -h` for a more detailed options explaination.

## FAQ
### I get `PTP_ERROR_IO` error with the messages below:
```

Try this in a terminal:
```
